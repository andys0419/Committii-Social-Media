<h1> About Me </h1>
<h3> Hi , my name is Christian Palladino. I'm a Junior studying Computer Science with a minor in math. In my (quickly diminishing) free time I like to play video games and hang out with my friends (in discord, nowadays). Currently, I'm an intern at Northrop Grumman, working there part-time during the school year.</h3>

<h1> Project Vision </h1>
<h3> As a team member of Elmas Eugenia, I hope to be able to improve my skills in front-end development, as well as the agile workflow. I've had some experience with the agile workflow at work, but not in a larger team setting. </h3>
