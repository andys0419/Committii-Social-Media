<h3> About Me </h3>
<h2> Hello, my name is Andy Shi. I'm currently pursing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. <br>Two of my favorite programming languages are Python and Java. <br> I'm hoping to learn more about Front End Development in 2021.<br>Outside of this pursuit, I enjoy playing video games and reading. <br>Recently, I've been developing interest in investing, and hope to spend more time researching this topic.</h2>
<h3> Project Vision </h3>
<h2> As a team member of Elmos Eugenia, I am looking to actively learn Front End Development through Figma and React JS. <br> My team and I are currently working on <em>Committii</em>, an application geared towards indecisive individuals.<br> People can vote on a given topic through <em>Committii</em> provided polls.  <br> </h2>
