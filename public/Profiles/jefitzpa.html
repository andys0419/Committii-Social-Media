<h1>Jake Fitzpatrick</h1>
<p>Hi I'm Jake Fitzpatrick, and I am a member of Elmas. We are working on a polling project that will enhance people's everydays lives. A little about myself is that I am a big yankees fan, and I run for the club track team. I really enjoy working out and fitness. This image represents me because it's my twitch logo. I have around 230 followers on twitch and then 600+ on tiktok. I think its pretty fun and I enjoy video editing. I also am the vice president of running club and I really enjoy it. I am excited to see what our project takes on and how it looks in the end.</p>
