<h4>Hello, I am on team elmas. We are developing Committii which is a polling social media app.</h4>
<h5>Alittle background about me, this is actually my second degree as I hold a degree in Business (Finance and Marketing) from the University at Albany where I was also a D1 soccer player.</h5>
<h5>I have also spent time in San Francisco working at Homeshare(failed startup) and Brex(unicorn startup) in Sales, Growth, and CX.</h5>
<h5>In my free time I love chipotle and spending time with my Teacup Pomeranian, Nugget and Bernadoodle, Waffles (he's a lot bigger now!)</h5>
