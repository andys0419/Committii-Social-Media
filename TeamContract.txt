As a team discuss 3 ways that you can help set expectations
1) Be clear on our goals and expectations and detail what each member is expected to contribute.
2) Set weekly meetings to catch up on where each member is from a progress perspective.
3) If a team member is struggling, be open and honest with the rest of the team to get assistance.

How will you resolve conflict?
Firstly as a group we will talk through the conflict and discuss pros and cons. If a resolution is still not reached, we will discuss with our PM to weigh their
input and hopefully realize the better course of action. If all else fails, we will play rock, paper scissors????
